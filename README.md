# -Abdulrazzaq2-s-Basic-DataBase-management-of-redAlert3-Game-in-cpp
hello, 
it is a c++ program with GUI using wcWidgets library + MySql to provide connection between DataBase and c++ for fast computing.

i used codeblocks IDE for c++ and xampp for mysql coding.

i chose RedAlert background to give more silhouette effects to GUI 

Reminder: you MUST open shouldREADME file to know necessary steps for using this project.

There Are Three Necessary Steps to Go:

-open XAMPP,click start next to APACHE and MySql, then click admit next to MySql word.
-so it will take you to web browser then from navigation bar select section "IMPORT" then choose "abdrazaq1.sql"
-after importing, RUN Test Window.exe and the gui appears just press "ctrl" so it will be totally ready to use, then have a good try.    

ENJOY...
